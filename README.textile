h2. Motivation

Classically Conway's Game of Life focuses on a square-based "game board" and
this project explores how the same rules and behaviors could adapt to a
hexagonal grid with cells who, unlike the typical implementation are either
dead or alive, have granular health or act like populations that grow and
shrink over time.


h2. Rules

Each cell can take on a "population value" from 0 to 1 and, at each step / 
generation in the simulation, the populations surrounding a cell are summed.
This surrounding population value is then evaluated against the following rules:
* If this sum exceeds 3 or is below 2, the population looses a value of 0.1.
* If this sum is in the range 2.5 to 3.5, the population gains a value of 0.1.
* All other values leae the cell's population unchanged.


h2. Visual Representation

A population value gives a cell an empty fill color (for empty). Cells with
population values from 0.1 to 0.9 are grey and grow darker as their values as
their values get larger. A population value of 1 (full capacity) recieves a
black fill.


h2. Technologies and Resources Used

The entire solution runs in JavaScript (ECMAScript), targeting the HTML5 canvas
element. While not written in Processing, the solution draws on
"The Nature of Code":http://natureofcode.com/ by "Daniel Shiffman":http://www.shiffman.net/.
The client side leverages jQuery, released under the "MIT License":http://jquery.org/license/.
